Hello, please see my HW04 submission!

## FINAL OBSERVATIONS

* Methodology: Recent standardized test scores were examined across all district schools by applying a variety of statistical measures. The data was aggregated according to several key categories (by individual school, per student spending, school size, etc) - observable trends are sumamrized below:

* There is a clearly observable inverse correlation between per student budget/spending and Overall Passing rate (students who pass both Math & Reading sections). It is counterintuitive that greater per student budget would yield lower Overall Passing rate - reccommend further root cause analysis to understand this inverse correlation and levereage learnings from low-spending/high-performing schools.

* There is a clearly observable correlation between school size and Overall Passing rate - larger schools tend to have much lower Overall Passing rate compared to smaller schools. This may also be related to school type - charter schools (90.4% OVerall Passing) significnatly outperformed district schools (53.6% Overall Passing) with charter schools being (on average) less than half the size of district schools. Recommend further analysis to determine whether root cause is more closely tied to school size or school type.

* It is also important to note that grade level did not appear to have a significant correlation to Overall Passing rate.
